    <p>Safety in everything is paramount, and motorcycling is no different. Whether you’re six months into your new adventure or 16 years passed that first ride, motorcycle gear is an investment that will always pay for itself. Sure, there are cheaper ways to go. Jeans and hiking boots are still in style. How much finance do you put into your gear, and when do you take that investment for granted?</p>
    <p>The old acronym ATGATT answers the questions directly: <b style="color: red;">All The Gear, All The Time</b>. A quick trip seems harmless, and surely nothing can happen, but statistically, it’s more likely you’ll encounter a problem near your home rather than on a longer trip over the weekend.</p>
    <p>When it comes to buying new motorcycle gear, what do you look for? Style before material? Function before fit? These are great questions, and we’re going to share what to look for in motorcycle gear for everyone.</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a id="helmet"></a>Helmet</h1>

    <p>Helmets are always a topic of discussion. Should I wear one? Do I really need one? And if I choose to buy one, what should it be? Remember ATGATT? <b style="color: #b0365a;">Yes, you need one!</b> There are three basic types to consider: full face, ¾ helmet, and a ½ helmet.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><u><b style="color: #b0365a;">Full Helmet</b></u>&#8211; The full helmet is going to offer you the most coverage around your head and face with additional protection at the base of your head. The eye protection will most likely be a visor that can be rotated up out of the way as needed. The visor can come in a variety of finishes, including a light tint, dark tint, a color variation, or just a simple clear. Protection is best on this type as it covers everything vital, should breathe well with ventilation, and can allow you to hear surrounding traffic and sounds for defensive riding.</li>
        <li><u><b style="color: #b0365a;">¾ Helmet</b></u>&#8211; The ¾ helmet is similar to the full-face helmet, but it doesn’t offer the same facial coverage. The side, top, and back of your head will be covered only. Visors for the ¾ helmet are usually a flip-down type that can be clear or a colored or tinted variety. Protection will be less than the full face in the chin and facial area, but other areas (side, back, and top) should be comparable. Hearing and ventilation will also be similar to a full-face helmet, as it should breathe well while wearing it, and you can hear what’s close to you.</li>
        <li><u><b style="color: #b0365a;">½ Helmet</b></u>&#8211; Now, the ½ helmet isn’t what most call the “brain bucket.” The ½ helmet will cover the top of your head with a partial cover of the side and back. It still offers protection but doesn’t cover your face in any way. Riders will usually choose some other form of eye protection like glasses or goggles. This style provides the least overall protection of the three due to the limited coverage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more information, check out our <a href="https://www.motorcyclelegalfoundation.com/the-safest-motorcycle-helmet-you-can-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article on how to choose the safest motorcycle helmet</a>. We discussed the different protective parts of the helmet and provided the recommendation to look at European manufacturers for their softer exterior. Whether you want a helmet from a European, US, or another region manufacturer, it needs to fit your head comfortably. The protection liners have different shapes and sizes, and you should try a few on to determine what brand suits you best. Once you know what brand(s) tend to fit comfortably, then you can start to narrow down your choice of model, features, and visual style.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Helmet Recommendations</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Full Face: AGV K5 S Tornado Helmet</b></u> –n unyielding pursuit of sport touring perfection, AGV reexamined the already-stellar ergonomics of the acclaimed K5 Helmet, gutted it and completely overhauled it from the inside out. Guess “good enough” doesn’t translate well into Italian. The AGV K5 S Helmet features an innovative comfort liner using a unique combination of Microsense-treated Ritmo and Shalimar high-performance fabrics with moisture wicking and antimicrobial properties.</li>
        <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Full Face / ¾ Hybrid:SHOEI NEOTEC 2o</b></u> &#8211; The Shoei Neotec 2 helmet finds ways to improve upon an already exceptional modular touring helmet. Exhaust outlets complement the upper air intake vents for improved air flow. Wind tunnel testing optimized the Neotec 2's aerodynamics to perform in a variety of riding positions. The integrated shell spoiler is repositioned to better reduce lift and drag at speed, while the Aero Deflector along the chin bar adds stability. .</li>
        <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">½ Helmet: Bell Pit Boss Helmet - Solid</b></u> – From the first time you put the Pit Boss helmet on, you can feel the difference. The ultra-light TriMatrix construction keeps weight to a minimum while still passing tough DOT standards. The Bell Pit Boss also features Bell’s innovative Speed Dial adjustable fit system which provides unmatched levels of comfort while drastically reducing the tendency for open face helmets to lift off of the head.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><a id="jacket"></a>Jacket</h1>

    <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No matter the weather or how far you plan to ride, a jacket is a must-have. Check out our </span><a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="https://www.motorcyclelegalfoundation.com/choosing-the-safest-motorcycle-jacket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">article on choosing a safe motorcycle jacket</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, where we uncover the different parts of a jacket and how each adds to a protective package that keeps you safe from the sting of a June bug on your next ride.</span></p>
    <p>There are a lot of materials available, from leather to synthetics that offer excellent protection, style, and function. It will be up to you to decide what to wear. Leather may look great with your rugged cruiser or flashy with your sports model, but a well-designed synthetic may suit your long touring motorcycle better over 1,000 miles of the open road. The jacket should fit comfortably without being too big and bulky, and offer the function you need. Pockets, both internal and external, may or may not be what you need or want, so choose wisely on what level of function you need to ride.</p>
    <h1 class="title">Jacket Recommendations</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Textile Mesh Jacket: Klim Induction</b></u> &#8211; The Klim Induction jacket was updated in 2017 and is one of the most functional, lightweight jackets on the market. The coloring is highly visible with added reflective inserts that make the rider easy to see in a day or nighttime traffic. The fit is snug but offers the rider enough room to wear a thicker layer of clothing underneath the jacket for extra warmth on the cooler riding days. If the afternoon temperatures heat up, you can easily remove them and allow the jacket ventilation to keep you comfortable.</li>
        <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Alpinestars Andes v2 Drystar Jacket</b></u> – Standing on the summit of the original Andes, the Alpinestars Andes V2 Drystar Jacket takes multi-season functionality to new heights with vastly improved temperature control.

            Where venting was previously somewhat limited, affording only exchange of heat and moisture through the Drystar membrane (and restricting application to the colder 3 seasons), highly efficient direct venting has been incorporated into the version 2 Alpinestars Andes Drystar Jacket, achieving true 4 season adaptability for the adventure and touring rider.</li>
        <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Leather Jacket: Cortech Piuma</b></u> – When someone hears leather jackets mentioned, Marlon Brando may come to mind. Leather jackets offer excellent protection and rugged good looks, but with the addition of mesh and protective panels, it comes a versatile jacket for all riders, no matter their style. The Cortech Piuma is made from cowhide leather with tight-knit, high-flow mesh fabric to increase ventilation. Reinforced zippers on all pockets, wrists, and closures offer security while riding, and reflective material on the outer arms and back increase nighttime visibility. You can also add additional armor to the Piuma if desired.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="title"><a id="suits"></a>Suits</h1>

    <p>Jackets and pants can be purchased separately, but there are other options in riding suits that may be better for you as a rider. Suits come in one and two-piece sets that offer the same level of protection, ventilation, material selection as a jacket, and pants combinations. It could also be argued that there&#8217;s better waterproofing in one-piece suits.</p>
    <p>As with pants and jackets, the fit of a suit should be comfortable without being bulky and cumbersome. They offer similar visibility to a separate jacket and pant combinations, and most two-piece suits are paired together so that they can attach at the waist to act like a one-piece suit.</p>
    <p>It&#8217;s up to you as a rider whether you feel more comfortable in a one or two-piece suit. Since both can attach at the waist, the decision point may be whether you want a jacket that can detach and be taken off at a restaurant for lunch. Although a set of one-piece leathers hanging behind you at the local burger joint looks excellent, it may not be the best fashion choice concerning onlookers (but who cares, right?)</p>




    <h1 class="title">Suit Recommendations</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Leather One-Piece Suit: Alpinestars Missile Race Suit</b></u>– This leather suit is standard of what you should expect in the more aggressive suits on the market. The suit is made for hard riding and comfort with stretch panels in the arms, crotch, and knees. Most are either leather or have a Kevlar mix meant to increase abrasion resistance in the case of an asphalt incident. Impact protection is offered on the chest, back, shoulders, hips, and legs, with a set of knee pucks ready to touch down. Most suits come with a mesh liner to offer cooling and ventilation.</li>

        </div>


        <h1 class="title"><a id="boots"></a>Boots</h1>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>These boots are made for riding, and that’s just what they’ll do, but sometimes they’re used to walk around in too. Motorcycle-specific boots are designed with rider-specific features and safety in mind. They are usually above the ankle footwear with built-in ankle protection, increased torsional stiffness for reduced flexing, and oil-resistant soles for a firm grip on the ground (as well as being stylish footwear). One of the more common injuries that can occur in motorcycling is when the foot is trapped under the motorcycle, and the ankle and lower leg take the force of the motorcycle falling. Sturdy protective motorcycle boots are the key to protecting the ankle bone.</p>
        <p>Laces on motorcycle boots will usually be on the inside of the boot to prevent tangling on the motorcycle. Exterior laces can get caught on the shifter, footpegs, etc. and prevent you from getting your foot down when you stop. Any boots with exterior laces should have the ability to tuck the laces into the boot. Beyond the laces, motorcycle boots should have a shifter pad meant to wear against the shift lever, secure buckles (if designed with buckles), and double or triple stitching that are durable enough to survive a slide on the ground. If laces aren’t your style, there are alternatives to Velcro or solid buckles that will secure your boot on your foot and still be comfortable.</p>
        <p>Motorcycle boots are generally made from high-quality thick leather that provides excellent abrasion resistance. Manufacturers recognize that leather doesn’t always breathe well, and they have started to design textile boots with high abrasion materials that are waterproof and with good ventilation. They also add replaceable plastic or leather reinforcements in the high wear areas on the toes, shifter pad, and heels. These can be changed when they wear out instead of needing to purchase a new pair of boots. You can also consider boots with metal toe protectors (internal or external to the boots) if you plan to ride in more stop and go traffic for added toe protection. If you choose a leather boot, make sure it is made from treated leather that won’t absorb water in a rainstorm. Soggy wet boots make for an uncomfortable ride.</p>
        <p>The last thing to emphasize about motorcycle boots is that they need to be comfortable on your foot to wear all day. Manufacturers make their boots specific to their brands, and just like helmets, they tend to fit feet a little differently by brand. Keep in mind the socks you plan to wear with the boots, as thick, heavy socks may make the boots too tight and limit ventilation during a long day of riding.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Boot Recommendations</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Sport / Race Boot: Joe Rocket Speedmaster 3.0 </b></u>– The Joe Rocket line features all mentioned features in protection and replaceable parts at a price that makes them a bargain. The boot is made from high-grade perforated leather with injection-molded shin, heel, and ankle armor for maximum protection. They also include magnesium toe sliders for when you want to ride hard and get your knee on the ground.</li>
            <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Cruising / Touring Boot: Highway 21 Spark</b></u> – For those that don’t want a full-on race boot, the Highway 21 line may be more to your style. These are designed in a more classic boot style, but feature high-grade leather construction with an oil-resistant sole. The liner is waterproof throughout, and the insole is removable. Putting them on is eased with a pull-loop to grab and pull on.</li>
            <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Adventure / Dual-Sport Boots: Gaerne Balanced Oiled</b></u> – Adventure boots are designed for the all-around rider. You’d most likely look for these if you plan to ride a dual-sport motorcycle with a mix of on and off-road riding. The Gaerne boots offer exterior buckles to secure the boots while the leather / ballistic nylon protects your foot and keeps it dry. These have a secure waterproof design that is meant to see water more often than a typical street rider would, and offer superior ankle protection for the trail rider.</li>

        <h1 class="title"><a id="gloves"></a>Gloves</h1>

        <p>Gloves are often not given the respect that they deserve. Gloves offer more protection for your hands than you realize. In the event of a fall, you’re more likely to put your hands out to catch yourself as a natural reaction.</p>
        <p>Just as with jackets and pants, there are a few material options to choose from. Leather is always a right choice, some offer additional padding and protection on the fingers, knuckles, and back of the hand and palm, and there are also textile blends that offer abrasion protection with waterproofing.</p>
        <p>When moving past the material discussion, on a basic level, gloves need to fit your hands snugly but comfortably. You have levers and buttons to manipulate while riding, and fumbling for the turn signal button in oversized ski gloves is just awkward, not to mention dangerous.</p>
        <p>Among the different styles of gloves available, there are a lot of choices to consider. Some want the protection and lightweight of a full race glove with carbon / Kevlar knuckles, ventilation, and wrist protection. If that’s too much, perhaps a touring glove that offers excellent protection, ventilation, and heating for hot and cold riding, and can go everywhere and do anything. If you plan to ride in a more urban setting, there are great offerings in a lightweight glove that don’t extend past your wrist that make it easy to ride with a jacket. With today’s technology in wireless communication, some will consider fingerless gloves to be able to use a mobile touch screen without needing to take the glove off. In those cases, we’d recommend finding a glove that has a touchscreen compatible palm rather than riding in fingerless gloves. You may never need their protection from the ground, but having a large bug or rock hit you in the finger is a stinging proposition.</p>
        <p>Once you have decided on material and features, finding the right size is your next challenge. As with helmets and boots, manufacturer sizes and shapes will vary slightly. European sizing and US sizes can be converted back and forth, but they still have a slight variation on what will truly fit your hands and comfortable cinch at the wrist. We’d recommend trying on a few sets of gloves in the material and style that you are interested in to find what fits comfortably snug without strangling your fingers or feeling like ski gloves ready for the slopes.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Glove Recommendations</h1>

        <ul>
            <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Textile Hybrid: Tour Master Cold Tex 3.0</b></u> – These Tour Master gloves feature a goatskin palm with a textile hand and wrist material. They are touchscreen compatible but offer a good all-around weather riding opportunity because they are waterproof and breathable. They have a thin polyester fleece liner for added warmth but aren’t internally heated for those really cold rides. They’d be an excellent option for most of the riding, just outside of the winter months.</li>
            <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Full Race: Alpinestars GP Racer</b></u> – The Alpinestars brand features full protection in a lightweight, comfortable, and durable glove. These are slightly curved to fit your hand better and offer a touchscreen-friendly palm and index finger, which is a benefit for those using a touchscreen device on a sporty ride.</li>
            <li><u><b style="color: #19487c;">Urban: Icon Pursuit Touchscreen</b></u> – These Icon gloves have all the standards features you would expect in a motorcycle glove. Integrated knuckle protection with a sheepskin leather offers excellent riding experience, but what makes them different than so many others is the goatskin touchscreen-friendly padding on the palm and fingers. You won’t need to remove the glove in order to use your touchscreen maps feature, which is one less thing to worry about on your next ride.</li>

        <p>Outside of the armor provided in motorcycle jackets and pants, there are added armor opportunities available that will work with your jacket and or pants to increase protection. Most motorcycle jackets offer padding or impact resistance at the waist, on the back and chest, and at the shoulders and elbows. You can add to that protection with an armored vest, a back protector, and even an airbag system, as you would find in most newer cars and trucks. The key with these added armor vests or pants is that they need to fit snugly to you with little movement and comfortably inside the jacket and pants you are wearing them under. You may need to take your favorite riding jacket and pants to a retailer to try somebody armor on and get a feel of the extra layer to make sure it’s the right option for you.</p>
